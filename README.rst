# pyccsds package

This is a Python package developed at Southwest Research Institute
that provides an IO interface for reading CCSDS data.  The work
is based upon ccsdspy from Daniel DaSilva, with some variation.

It uses a high level Object-Oriented interface method that attempts
to build the suite of tools which can interact with the CCSDS space 
packet protocol based upon the flight software documentation provided
by the various instrument teams.

The pyccsds package makes use of the numpy package.
